# Social Impact Hack Idee: Gaming of the entrepreneurial journey 

## THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY - An Interactive Online and Offline Game (not just) For Refugee

####Proposal Summary

This brand new computer game utilizes entrepreneurial skills to strengthen not only vital hard skills for aspiring entrepreneurs, but also relevant soft skills - both online and offline. It will be co-created with refugee entrepreneurs to ensure a good target group fit. The game is thus also a clear signal to the wider society: Refugees are not passive receivers of support, they create meaningful benefit for their own community and for other entrepreneurs.

The game will be developed in a unique partnership between SINGA Business Lab and Get YourWings, an organization dedicated to educating school pupils in digital competencies.

#### How it will work - Online version

Players face the challenge of starting their own business and go through all of the essential steps while playing the game:
They design a business idea and research the necessary steps to implement it.

The game takes them from the idea to the viable concept - including market and target group analysis, marketing, sales and branding, personnel as well as financial planning. The game creates a business plan, and in addition, players discover personal skills they bring to the table and what they should pay attention to concerning personnel choices.

Financing and insurance are addressed as well as the selection of a suitable company type. This leads to important questions regarding registrations and approvals, tax regulations and necessary memberships.

#### The Offline Variety

The gameplay is flanked with offline elements, such as playing cards with advice, information and tasks. These target specific problems, such as the evaluation of application documents, the selection of suitable suppliers and the integration of external competencies, some of which have to be worked out in role-play.

#### The Impact on Refugee Entrepreneurs

The training of hard and soft skills,which are supported in the computer game enable students to shape their own future. In the game, they learn how complex challenges actually work in day-to-day environments and that they need meaningful strategies for optimal
